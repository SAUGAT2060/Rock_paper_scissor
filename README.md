Rock Paper Scissors Game ðŸŽ®
A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me understand key JavaScript concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, localStorage, and random number generation.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Interactive UI with button-based gameplay
Randomized computer moves using Math.random()
Persistent score tracking with localStorage
Clean and responsive design with CSS
This was a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m excited to improve and build more! ðŸš€
